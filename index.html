        <h3>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Trends in 2022</h3>
        <h5>By Dev Sharma on January 7,2023</h5><br>

        <img src="https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/05/58/42/48/240_F_558424886_OF1uhPXTaiD886plHMrWkvjrXtTri9lU.jpg"

        <p style="font-size: 15px;">This article will cover the artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)
            trends forecasted for the
            business landscape in 2022, but readers need to keep in mind that businesses are still contending with the
            pandemic, as well as labor shortages, economic crisis, and many other problematic factors. While some
            businesses worldwide have certainly come out stronger during these global crises, many have not, but for
            nearly everyone advanced technologies have revolutionized the way we live and work.2020 and 2021 made us
            realize that technology is potentially an advantageous savior and certainly an important guide during a
            crisis. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and associated technologies have the potential to
            resurrect traditional business models from total chaos to a highly streamlined, cost-friendly, and efficient
            workflow. <br>The “intelligent” component of the intelligent digital mesh mostly refers to AI, ML (and
            related technologies), as these two drive the “brains” of smart machines to deliver business value. AI and
            ML collaboratively play a critical role in the intelligent digital world of business — enabling machines to
            mimic human thinking and human tasks. Businesses have learned to trust advanced technologies and endorse
            technology-enabled business models.</p>
        <p> This discussion of artificial intelligence and machine learning
            trends in 2022 begins with statistics, which show the progression of ideas featured here:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ninety-three percentof the environmental sustainability goals (as defined by the United Nations) can be
                achieved with artificial intelligence</li>
            <li>Sustainable AI systems, with the current pace of adoption, have the potential to create 38.2 million
                jobs across the globe</li>
            <li>From 2020 to 2027, the global AI-driven cybersecurity market has been projected to grow at a CAGR of
                23.6%, reaching $46 billion by the end of the projection period</li>
            <li>While 51% of enterprises have plans to implement AI for automated processes, 25% of companies are
                already doing so</li>
            <li>In 2020, 80% of executive staff were busy accelerating the automation initiatives of business processes
            </li>
            <li>By 2023, 40% of infrastructure and operations (I&O) teams in large organization will use AI-powered
                augmented solutions, with the intention of freeing up the busy IT staff for more strategic work</li>
            <li>According to a 2020 McKinsey Report, 66% of businesses gained higher revenue due to their AI systems
            </li>
            <li>In 2021, 74% of companies allocated $50,000 or more for AI projects, which is a significant 55% increase
                in AI budget from 2020</li>
            <li>In 2022, every company is predicted to have 35 AI projects in development</li>
            <li>By 2023, AI professionals must demonstrate solid understanding of responsible AI principles to secure
                their careers</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="font-weight: bold;">Factors Affecting AI Adoption Businesses in 2022</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>“Launching pilots is deceptively easy but deploying them into production is notoriously challenging …
                Although
                the potential for success is enormous, delivering business impact from AI initiatives takes much longer
                than
                anticipated.” — Chirag Dekate, Senior Director Analyst at Gartner
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Here are some factors that can have high impact on AI project implementation throughout organizations in
            2022:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Increased IT budgets for AI, as reflected by statistics provided by Appen, Gartner, McKinsey, or World
                economic Forum</li>
            <li>Pandemic-triggered accelerated digitization of businesses in an unprecedented manner, thus creating a
                market of highly skilled IT workforce in 2021</li>
            <li>Fifty countries including the US, UK, and China have national AI strategies in development. This may
                encourage other countries to initiate similar efforts</li>
            <li>Some environmental issues are necessitating the use of AI, such as the effort to tackle climate change
            </li>
            <li>In 2020, the FBI received 69% more cybercrime complaints than in 2019. The explosive rise of cybercrimes
                has created an urgent need for AI-driven cyber-security solutions</li>
            <li>In 2020, only 11% of AI adopters saw ROI from their AI projects. An Alegion and Dimensional Research
                survey indicates that 78% of all AI/ML projects never experience full implementation, possibly due to
                low C Suite buy-in</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Which AI Trends Are About to Emerge in 2022?</h3>
        <p>This TechTarget article indicates AI is moving toward “conceptual design, smaller devices and multi-modal
            applications,” which will collectively dominate industry sectors. Quantum AI has been used as an example of
            that forward trend.</p>
        <p>As mentioned earlier, multi-modal learning, AutoML, conceptual design, Democratized AI, Responsible AI, or
            Quantum ML — all present in the 2021 AI research landscape — will show more impact through industry
            applications in 2022.</p>
        <p>A long list of AI trends is likely to dominate the business landscape in 2022. Here are five major AI trends
            to watch for:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Augmented Business Processes and Systems: 2022 will give a boost to all types of automated systems
                powered by AI, like augmented Data Management and augmented analytics, to achieve operational
                excellence, cost efficiencies, and resilience. The combined impact of cloud, robotic process automation
                (RPA), and IoT, will make AI-augmented automation a dream come true for businesses.</li>
            <li>Rise of Responsible AI: “Responsible AI helps achieve fairness …”,says Svetlana Sicular, Research VP at
                Gartner. Increasingly, certain industry sectors are demanding that automated systems spitting out
                decisions must be able to explain the logic behind the decisions. Additionally, such decisions must be
                totally free of bias (fair). Available industry publications clearly indicate “ethical, responsible
                artificial intelligence usage will be one of the defining AI trends” for 2022.</li>
            <li>Use of AI in Cybersecurity: AI algorithms have already been used for preventing cyber attacks,
                monitoring corporate networks, detecting malicious software, and other applications. Now business users
                are troubled by smart hackers who manipulate data used in model training, access sensitive data by
                reverse engineering AI systems, or detect security weak spots in corporate systems. To counter these
                cyber threats, businesses now want AI solutions to closely screen all data used for model training and
                to inject special security elements in the AI models.</li>
            <li>Hyperautomation in Healthcare: Healthcare delivery systems will allow care providers to make quicker and
                more accurate decisions; help drug companies bring high quality products to market in record time;
                streamline healthcare system workflow; and reduce costs by automating human labor.</li>
        </ul>
